# RTK (Token Killer)

RTK is a CLI proxy that compresses bash output before it reaches the model.
The `coding` loadout installs the GitHub `rtk-ai/rtk` binary and a fail-open
rewrite hook. Prefix noisy commands with `rtk` when the hook is not in play.

**Core principle:** the right binary answers `rtk gain`. crates.io `rtk` is a
different project (Rust Type Kit).

## When to use

- Shell output from git, test runners, directory listings, or linters is large
- The user asks for rtk / Token Killer
- You are about to install or verify `rtk`

**Skip** for interactive TTY tools, binary downloads, and commands the user
asked to see unfiltered.

## Install and identity

This loadout's `cli_tools` installs a pinned GitHub release into
`~/.local/bin`. Do not pipe an upstream install script to a shell. Do not
install the crates.io crate named rtk (Rust Type Kit). `cargo install --git
https://github.com/rtk-ai/rtk` is a last resort only if the user asks.

Verify: `rtk gain` prints a savings dashboard. If that fails, PATH has the
wrong binary or none.

Do not run `rtk init`. Loadout owns `.cursor/hooks.json` and
`.claude/settings.json`. `rtk init` writes a competing global hook. Sync
already registers `rtk hook cursor` / `rtk hook claude` via `hooks/rtk-rewrite`.

## Commands

```bash
rtk git status
rtk pytest -q
rtk gain          # confirm Token Killer, not crates.io
```

The rewrite hook remaps Cursor `.command` to `rtk hook cursor` and delegates
Claude PreToolUse to `rtk hook claude`. Missing `rtk` fails open.

## Common mistakes

| Excuse | Reality |
| --- | --- |
| "curl the install script" | Unpinned pipe-to-shell. Use loadout sync. |
| "install crates.io rtk" | Wrong package. Check `rtk gain`. |
| "rtk init to enable hooks" | Fights this loadout. Do not. |
